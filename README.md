# Tenzies Game

A simple and fun dice game built with React.js, where the player rolls dice until all are the same number. Players can “hold” dice to keep their values while rolling the rest — a quick, addictive mini-game demonstrating React hooks and state management.


# Features
i. Roll dice until all match  
ii. Hold dice to lock their values  
iii. Reroll only unheld dice  
iv. Track number of rolls and time taken  
v. Built entirely with React functional components and hooks  
vi. Save best score in local storage  


# How to Play
- Click Roll to roll all dice.    
- Click on individual dice to hold them at their current value.  
- Keep rolling until all dice show the same number.  
- Once all dice match, you win 🎉
